    "Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides tools for making decisions based on data and helps in understanding and quantifying variability, uncertainty, and patterns in data.Two fundamental ideas in the field of statistics are: \n",

    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and organizing data so that it can be easily understood. This includes measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphical representations like histograms and box plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It includes techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis to draw conclusions and make decisions.\n"
