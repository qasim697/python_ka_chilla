    "## Steps of Inferential Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential analysis involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. Here are the key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Population**: Clearly define the population you are interested in studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formulate Hypotheses**: Develop null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis typically states that there is no effect or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis states the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select a Sample**: Choose a representative sample from the population. The sample size should be adequate to make reliable inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collect Data**: Gather data from the selected sample using appropriate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choose a Statistical Test**: Select a statistical test based on the type of data and the hypotheses. Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate Test Statistic**: Compute the test statistic using the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Determine P-value**: Find the p-value associated with the test statistic. The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Make a Decision**: Compare the p-value to a significance level (usually 0.05). If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Draw Conclusions**: Interpret the results in the context of the research question and the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Report Findings**: Document the methodology, analysis, and conclusions in a clear and concise manner.\n"

    "## Real World Example: Effect of a New Drug on Blood Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define the Population\n",
    "The population of interest is adults aged 30-60 who have been diagnosed with hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Formulate Hypotheses\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The new drug lowers blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Select a Sample\n",
    "A sample of 100 adults aged 30-60 with hypertension is selected randomly from a larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Collect Data\n",
    "Blood pressure readings are taken before and after administering the new drug for a period of 8 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Choose a Statistical Test\n",
    "A paired t-test is chosen to compare the blood pressure readings before and after the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Calculate Test Statistic\n",
    "The test statistic is calculated using the sample data. This involves computing the mean difference in blood pressure before and after the treatment and the standard deviation of the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Determine P-value\n",
    "The p-value associated with the test statistic is determined. This p-value indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Make a Decision\n",
    "Compare the p-value to a significance level (Î± = 0.05). If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Draw Conclusions\n",
    "If the null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that the new drug significantly lowers blood pressure in adults aged 30-60 with hypertension. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest that the new drug has an effect on blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Report Findings\n",
    "Document the methodology, analysis, and conclusions in a clear and concise manner. Include details about the sample, data collection methods, statistical test used, test statistic, p-value, and the final conclusion."

    "1. **Data Distribution Normality Test**: Assess whether the data follows a normal distribution. Common tests include the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n",

    "2. **Homogeneity Test**: Check if the variances across groups are equal. Levene's test and Bartlett's test are commonly used for this purpose.\n",

    "- **Chi-Square Tests**: Used for categorical data to assess relationships between variables.\n"
